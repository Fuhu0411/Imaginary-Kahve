    Instead of typing in all the values, given a hypothetical situation where I have a coffee shop, 
    where I can get orders from my VIP customers or new ones, I keep track of all the orders and calculate 
    the sales summary.
    
    I randomize the orders so that every time I run the prorgam, I get a different set of orders
    
    The two files to run are: 
        1. GrossSales.java - for the sales summary
        2. main.java - for the receipts generations
    
    What to expect:
        1. All the receipts printed to the console
        2. The text file for Sales Summary
    
    Services traits:
        1. Sizes: CUCUK, NORMAL, BUYUK
        2. Takeaway: true / false
        3. Sugar amount
        4. Different cup sizes
    
    Requirements:
        1. Make sure the file paths are correctly configured to your machine before running
